They’re generally solid, but for Apple you should tighten a few areas: age/rating alignment, gambling clarity, subscriptions/refunds, and dispute/consumer rights language.

Below is a revised, drop‑in version tuned for App Store expectations, with your structure preserved and Apple‑friendly clarifications added. This is not legal advice, but it will align better with Apple’s review lens for UGC, simulated gambling/side games, and subscriptions.

Terms of Service
Last updated: September 25, 2025

Welcome to ForeScore. ForeScore is a service of danoNano, LLC (dba ForeScore) ("ForeScore," "we," "our," or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the ForeScore web and mobile applications, websites, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

Eligibility & Accounts
You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age of digital consent in your country) to use the Service. If your jurisdiction requires you to be older to enter into a binding contract or to participate in golf‑related side games or wagering‑adjacent activities, you must meet that higher age threshold. You are responsible for the accuracy of your account information and all activity under your account. If you use a third‑party login (e.g., Google, Apple, Facebook), you must comply with that provider's rules. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for promptly notifying us of any unauthorized use of your account.

What ForeScore Does (and Doesn't Do)
ForeScore provides tools to organize golf groups, track side games (such as "Sacramento (916)") and other scoring formats, and calculate suggested payouts or point allocations based on your group's inputs and rules. The Service is intended purely as a scoring and organizational utility for recreational golf; it is not a gambling or gaming operator.

No Gambling or Real‑Money Gaming. ForeScore does not offer, enable, or process real‑money gambling, wagering, lotteries, sweepstakes, or contests of chance. The Service does not handle deposits, withdrawals, bets, or prize payments, and does not provide any mechanism to transfer money or value between users. Any real‑world settlements, payments, or exchanges among players occur entirely outside the Service and at users’ sole discretion and risk. You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws where you play and for ensuring that your use of the Service does not violate any gambling or gaming regulations in your jurisdiction.

Utility Only. Suggested scores, points, handicaps, or payouts generated by the Service are for informational and entertainment purposes only. We do not guarantee accuracy, fairness, or compliance with any governing body’s handicapping or competition rules, and you should independently verify any calculations that matter for your group.

User-Generated Content & Conduct
You may submit content such as profile names, group names, game configurations, messages, and scores ("User-Generated Content" or "UGC"). You retain rights to your UGC, but you grant ForeScore a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host, store, display, reproduce, modify, and adapt it solely as needed to operate, provide, secure, and improve the Service.

You agree not to:

Upload or share unlawful, infringing, defamatory, harassing, hateful, discriminatory, pornographic, or misleading content.

Use the Service to threaten, bully, or abuse others, or to promote self-harm, illegal activity, or hate.

Spam, scrape, reverse engineer, or interfere with the Service or its security.

Attempt to circumvent technical protections, usage limits, or access controls.

We may remove content or suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, our policies, or applicable law. We may also take reasonable steps to moderate UGC, including automated or manual review, but we do not promise to monitor all activity and you remain responsible for your own conduct.

Marketing Communications
By creating an account, you consent to receive marketing and promotional communications from ForeScore, including emails, push notifications, and other messages. You may opt out at any time by following unsubscribe instructions in those messages or by adjusting your notification or device settings. Opting out of marketing will not affect essential service communications (e.g., transactional or security notices).

Privacy
Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, the legal bases for processing, and your choices regarding data access, correction, deletion, and marketing preferences. Please review the Privacy Policy carefully before using the Service. Where required by law, we will honor your privacy rights requests and provide appropriate data protection disclosures.

License & Intellectual Property
Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for its intended purpose on devices you own or control. All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service (excluding UGC) remain with ForeScore and its licensors, including all software, text, graphics, logos, trademarks, and other content. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code except as permitted by law.

Payments, Subscriptions & Trials (if offered)
If we offer paid features, in‑app purchases, or subscriptions, the following apply:

Pricing & Billing. We will disclose pricing, billing frequency, and, where applicable, the free trial period and any introductory offers at the point of purchase in the app and/or on the Service. Any taxes or fees will be disclosed where required.

Subscriptions & Auto-Renewal. If you purchase a subscription, it may auto-renew at the end of each billing period unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the then-current period, as described in the purchase flow. You can manage or cancel your subscription through your device account settings (e.g., Apple ID subscription settings) or as otherwise described in the app.

Free Trials. If a free trial is offered, we will specify its duration and what happens when it ends. Unless you cancel before the trial ends, your subscription may convert to a paid plan as disclosed at sign‑up.

Refunds. Where purchases are made through a platform provider (such as Apple’s App Store), that provider’s refund policies apply, and you may need to request refunds directly from them. For purchases made directly via our website or other channels, our own refund policy (if any) will apply, and we will describe it clearly at the time of purchase. Nothing in these Terms limits any mandatory refund or cancellation rights you may have under applicable law.

Third-Party Services
The Service may link to or integrate with third-party tools or services (e.g., chat platforms, analytics providers, payment processors). These third-party services are not under our control, and ForeScore is not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Your use of any third-party service is at your own risk and may be governed by that third party’s terms and privacy policy.

Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, OR RELIABILITY. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so the above may not fully apply to you. In that case, the duration of any required warranties will be limited to the minimum period permitted by law.

Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FORESCORE AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM OR (B) USD $50.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability; in those cases, these limitations will apply to you only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ForeScore and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your UGC; (b) your use or misuse of the Service; or (c) your violation of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation.

Suspension & Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service, or remove UGC, if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms, our policies, or applicable law, or if we need to do so to protect the Service or other users. Where reasonable, we will attempt to provide notice of material suspensions or terminations. You may stop using the Service and close your account at any time through your account settings or by contacting us.

Sections relating to intellectual property, payments and subscriptions, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, governing law, and dispute resolution will survive termination.

Changes to the Service and to These Terms
We may update or modify the Service from time to time, including by adding or removing features. We may also update these Terms. If changes are material, we will notify you through the Service, by email, or by other reasonable means. Changes take effect when posted unless otherwise stated. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective means you accept the revised Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.

Governing Law & Jurisdiction
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Arizona, USA, without regard to its conflict-of-law rules, except where applicable law in your country requires a different governing law for consumer contracts. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona, USA, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts, except where applicable law gives you the right to bring claims in your local courts.
